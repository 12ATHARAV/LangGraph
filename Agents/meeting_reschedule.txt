Subject: Unable to Attend Upcoming Meeting

Hi Tom,

I regret to inform you that I won't be able to attend our scheduled meeting at 10 am in New Jersey due to prior commitments. However, I am available to attend the meeting at 12 PM in Delhi. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and would be happy to reschedule if possible.

Thank you for your understanding.

Best regards,
Atharav Dhumone
